## Before getting into the repo itself, the material shown in here is not supossed to be used as a main source to learn from, as the repository's name says: these are just notes that I have made because I was bored enough. Almost all of the notes you'll find will be in spanish because it is my mother language. I'll be translating the repositoy as the time pass by.

In the testing branch I'll be refactoring each exercises if I find a better way to accomplish the requirements.
