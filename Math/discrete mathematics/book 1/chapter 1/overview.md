## Overview
When we face a mathematical problem we are used to start by playing around with the formulas, drawing pictures that tries to describe grafically what is given within the statement of the problem. A good point to start is to acknowledge the importance of discovering the unknown, in order to complete this step, we must understand the language that is being speaked.

To speak a *mathematical language* is a requisite, because there's no particularly (and good) reason to make the problem more complex, on the other hand it does simplify it by avoiding some confusion led by our grammar and the way english is interpreted.

This chapter will give us a good grasp of *what speaking mathematically* really is and how it does looks like, by learning its foundations : variables, sets, relations and functions.
